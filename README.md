## ToDo's:

General:
* Split code into folders now that we actually have enough files for things to get messy
* Test whether new line endings settings work
* php-proxy.php needs to be updated so that it specifically handles all of the curl calls to jweb and shouldn't be a "general proxy" like we thought at first for securty reasons
